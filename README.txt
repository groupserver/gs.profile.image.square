Introduction
============

This product supplies the core code for displaying profile images. It
provides a `content provider`_, a view_, a class_, and a `missing image`_
resource.

Content Provider
================

The ``groupserver.UserImage`` content provider is used by almost all the
code that needs to display a profile image::

  <div tal:define="user view/userInstanceToShow"
       tal:replace="structure provider:groupserver.UserImage" />

It returns a ``<div>`` element (with the ``userimage`` and ``photo``
classes) that contains an ``<img>`` element. The ``src`` attribute of the
``<img>`` element points to the `view`_. The size of the image defaults to
54×72 pixels [#units]_ with the ``width`` and ``height`` attributes of the
``<img>`` element set.

Two optional arguments can be passed to the content provider to change the
size: ``width`` and ``height``. While the size of the image will be changed,
the aspect ratio of the image is preserved (see View_ below)::

  <div tal:define="user view/userInstanceToShow;
                   width string:14; height string:18;"
       tal:replace="structure provider:groupserver.UserImage" />


View
====

The view ``/p/{userId}/gs-profile-image`` is a view that returns the image
for the user. The ``gs-profile-image`` view provides an **API** for
resizing the profile image [#api]_. Two optional arguments can be passed as
part of a path.

* Not providing any arguments displays the image that the participant
  originally uploaded::

    /p/mpj17/gs-profile-image

* If only the *width* is supplied the height will be calculated, keeping
  the same aspect ratio as the original image. A new image will be returned
  that is scaled as requested. For example, setting the width to 100px::

    /p/mpj17/gs-profile-image/100

* The *height* is specified after the width. The image will be scaled so
  neither the width nor the height will be exceeded. However, the *aspect
  ratio* will be preserved, so one dimension may be smaller than requested
  [#resize]_. For example, ensuring that the width does not exceed 100px,
  and the height is smaller than to 125px::

    /p/mpj17/gs-profile-image/100/125

The scaling of the image is carried out by the ``UserImage`` class_.  If
the participant lacks an image then the viewer is redirected to the
`missing image`_ resource instead.

Class
=====

The class ``gs.profile.image.base.UserImage`` is a subclass of
``gs.image.GSImage``. It differs in the constructor, which takes a
``context`` and a user-info, rather than a file. 

The ``context`` and user-info are used to construct a *glob* for the file
[#glob]_, looking in the ``groupserver.user.image`` data-directory (usually
found beneath ``var/instance/groupserver.data`` in the GroupServer
directory). A glob is used so different file types, with different
extensions, can be used.

If the file cannot be found then an ``IOError`` is thrown. The error has
the following properties set.

``errno``:
  The error number is set to ``errno.ENOENT``.

``filename``:
  The *glob* that was used to try and find the file.

Missing Image
=============

The resource ``/++resource++gs-profile-image-base-missing.jpg`` is the
*missing profile image* image.

.. [#units] 54×72 pixels is 3×4 units in the standard `GroupServer CSS`_.

.. [#api] The API is the same as the images supported by
          ``Products.XWFFileLibrary2``.

.. [#resize] The algorithm for resizing the profile image is carried out by
             ``gs.image``. It is based on `code by a Kevin`_ on the
             Image-SIG list.
